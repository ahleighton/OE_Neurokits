Charged particles exert electric force
*****************************************
Our biological signals are generated by ions, either positively charged (Na\ :sup:`+`\, |K+|, |Ca2+|)  or negatively charged (|Cl-|).  Electrons are the negatively charged particles in our electrodes and wires (i.e., metal) that allow these components to conduct electrical signals.
Charged particles exert an electric force on other charged particles.

Coulombâ€™s law (Eq 1) describes that this force will have both magnitude (it will be bigger if the charges are larger or closer together) and direction (it will either attract or repel, depending on whether the charges have different or the same polarity).

We often represent electric force using electric field lines surrounding the particle. These lines show that charges in the vicinity of the particle will be influenced by its force in a particular direction.

If a charged particle is free to move (for instance, it is an ion in the cytoplasm, and not bound to a membrane) and placed within an electrical field, then these forces acting on it will cause it to move in a certain direction.
