A complete data acquisition system consists of the following components:

An acquisition board, which you can either order or build yourself (see below).
At least one Intan RHD-series headstage, which you can order directly from Intan. Each headstage can handle 16 to 128 channels of neural input. You can connect up to 8 headstages to each acquisition board. We recommend part #C3324 (32 channels with accelerometer), but any of the "RHD" headstages will work with our board.
One SPI cable to connect each headstage to the acquistion board, which you can order from Intan or build yourself. We recommend the "Ultra-Thin" variety for freely-moving applications.
(Optional) At least one I/O board for other (non-neural) signals, which you can build yourself. Each I/O board has 8 channels and can be used for one of the following at a time: digital input, digital output, analog input, or analog output.
(Optional) One HDMI cable to connect each I/O board to the acquisition board.
A computer to run the software and interface with the rest of the system.
