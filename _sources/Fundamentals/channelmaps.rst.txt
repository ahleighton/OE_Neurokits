Channel Mapping


To work out how each electrode corresponds to a channel on the software, you need:

- The headstage map
- The EIB map (if using)
- The probe layout (if using)

Headstage Maps:

- Onix low profile headstage mapping (not yet released)
- Low profile OEPS SPI headstage mapping (here)
- Omnetics intan headstage mapping (looks like this, acquired with starter kit) 

EIB Maps:

- Flexdrive
- Omnetics 64
- Omnetics 32 channel


Example:

Using Omnetics 32 with intan headstage acquired with starter kit
